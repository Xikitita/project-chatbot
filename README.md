## The problem
The problem this week was that my teammates and I had problems with syncing our schedules. We never went further than the planning state and the result is 
done with help from another classmate that jumped in to help me during the last hours. 
We will take up on this and finish the project as soon as we can! 

In order to start building the chatbot we went throught the material provided by Technigo, did additional search to try to build knowledge on how to do. We have used functions within Javascript. It took alot of time to understand how to create the chatbot as the whole chatbot tend to crash when we added knew funtionality. That requierd much time to find the what we did wrong.
If we would have had more time we would have done all the steps requierd
